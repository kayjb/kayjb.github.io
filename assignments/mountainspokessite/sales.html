              <figcaption><strong>Road Bike</strong><br>
                
                <br><em>Best For:</em> Traveling on pavement over long distance at fast speeds; great for those who want to participate in races or who have a long commute to work.<br>

            <br>Road bikes are the type most commonly used by professionals during road races, such as the Tour de France. They feature narrow wheels, a light frame, and typically have drop-bar handles that curve downward and toward the rider. Generally speaking, road bikes are more expensive than other types of bikes because of the materials and components used to make them light, agile, and aerodynamic.<br>

            <br>The drop handles require riders to lean farther forward at the waist, a position some find uncomfortable when held for a long period of time. If comfort is a primary concern, traditional road bikes might not be a good fit. There are road bikes that feature straight bar handles – handles that are straight across and parallel to the ground. This style is commonly referred to as a “fitness” road bike, although the only real difference between the fitness version and the traditional version is the handlebars.<br>

            <br>While fitness road bikes are not quite as common as the drop-bar model, this version does allow you to sit straighter on the bike, reducing lower back strain, a benefit to those who are new to road cycling and may need to improve overall skill before engaging in the more aerodynamic positioning required with the drop-bar handlebars.<br>

                <br><em>Typical Pricing:</em> $500 and up – many models are priced well over $2,000. Beginner road cyclists can pick up a quality bike for between $800 and $1,200. More expensive bikes feature more expensive components, such as lightweight carbon frames – features that are nice, but mostly unnecessary for non-competing cyclists.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><strong>Mountain Bikes</strong><br>
                
                <br><em>Best For:</em> Off-road adventures covering rough terrain, such as rocks, tree roots, and single-track trails.<br>

            <br>Mountain bikes are built rugged to handle anything Mother Nature throws at them. They typically feature wider tires with knobby tread to easily roll over rocks and roots. They also offer front- and rear-wheel suspension to reduce impact as you roll over rough terrain.<br>

            <br>Mountain bikes tend to be heavier and slower than other bikes on the market due to their durable frame and components. While they can be ridden on pavement and streets, they’re less efficient than other models. Unless you actually plan to take advantage of the features of a mountain bike, there’s no point in paying for them when you could opt for a hybrid bike instead. Also, keep in mind that mountain bikes are starting to get seat tube angles more commonly associated with triathlon bikes: as steep as 76º, or more.<br>

            <br>If you do plan on riding your bike on city streets rife with potholes, gravel pits, and curbs, a mountain bike might actually be a reasonable solution. Just make sure the terrain actually warrants the purchase.<br>

                <br><em>Typical Pricing:</em> $400 to well over $2,000. That said, a high-quality mountain bike can be purchased for between $800 and $1,500. Like road bikes, mountain bike pricing varies greatly by the components and features included. Mountain bikes with lightweight carbon frames, 29-inch wheels, and high-end suspension systems are going to cost more than those without. Before shelling out a lot of money on a higher-end bike, consider the type of mountain biking you’re likely to do. If you’re going to ride well-groomed trails with few drop-offs, rocks, or other barriers, you can probably get away with purchasing a less technical bike.</figcaption>

              <figcaption><strong>Hybrid Bikes</strong><br> 
                
                <br><em>Best For:</em> Riders who want a durable and fast bike that handles city terrain with ease, but can also be used on well-maintained trails; good for the novice road racer or triathlete.<br>
                
            <br>A hybrid bike is an excellent option if you’re mainly using your bike for commuting to and from work, maybe with the odd bit of recreational riding at the weekend. We’ve had the pleasure of carrying out a few hybrid bike reviews, and have collected some of the best models we’ve tested.<br>

            Hybrid bikes are ideal for riders just getting in to cycling: the best hybrid bikes will be good enough to cope with all sorts of terrain without fuss, hopefully helping you to enjoy your cycling and get more involved in this great sport.<br>
            
            <br>Hybrids typically borrow the flat, straight handlebars and upright seating posture of a mountain bike, which many bicyclists find comfortable and intuitive. Hybrids also employ the lighter weight, thinner wheels and smooth tires of road bikes.<br>

            <br>Hybrid bikes combine features to create a reasonably fast option that is more agile than a mountain bike, but sturdier than a road bike. The result is a high-quality solution perfect for the potholes, curbs, and gravel frequently encountered on city streets. Hybrid bikes are also effective for novice road racers or triathletes who want to start competing, but aren’t ready to commit to a pricey race bike. Hybrid bikes feature midsized tires, as well as straight handlebars, which are preferred by most riders.<br>

                <br><em>Typical Pricing:</em> $400 to $1,500. As with all bikes, you get what you pay for. Most commuters can get away with a $500 to $700 bike with a heavier, less expensive frame, and mid-level gear, handlebar, and seat components. Those purchasing a bike for racing purposes might want to spend more for a lighter weight frame, smoother gears, a better seat, and other higher-end features.</figcaption>
